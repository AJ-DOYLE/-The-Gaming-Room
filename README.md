## Design Summary

The Gaming Room seeks to create a web-based game called Draw It or Lose It, in which players must guess the picture as the application renders it. The game must be able to put players into teams, render images from a database, keep time and allow players to go in turns. The design document outlines the needs and recommendations to enable the web-based game to work cross-platform efficiently. Topics such as storage, memory management, networks, operating platforms, and security are covered in the document, which outlines how the developer should create the application. The second of servers, hosting, clients, and tools could be revised to have more direct and specific recommendations. 

Some of the program's needs are storing and rendering 200 high-definition images totaling around 1.6 GB to be displayed to the user during gameplay. The app previously existed in a mobile application version, so sharing a database across different platforms is essential for the game's functionality. Planning and implementing the client's needs and game application were taken in an area-by-area approach. For example, the memory management needs of the web application are critical as it is a game and web-based. Hence, speed and functionality are essential for the game to be enjoyable for the user. Since web applications tend to be slower and less reliable when compared to native apps, there is a great deal of change needs to be made when creating a browser-dependent web application from an existing mobile application.
